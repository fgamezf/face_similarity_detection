# Face Similarity Detection
The main goal of this project is researching about how to detect whether a new peson appears in front of the camera.
Performance is important because this program will be run in low cost devices such as RaspBerry Pi or Android devices.

The first approach calculates Width/Length face ratio from Face Landmarks provided by MediaPipe.
